Use machine learning to detect whether lines in a file are python code, Java code, or not code.


Run `download_sites.py` to download the files listed in `urls_java.txt` and `urls_python.txt`. They will be downloaded to the folder `./sites`.

Run `extract_sites.py` to extract code/not code to the folder `./samples`


The ipython notebook is at `MachineLearning/Tfidf-RF.ipynb`
